# Conversion for `common/ipld-multi.ts`

## `export const cborDecodeMulti = (encoded: Uint8Array): unknown[]`

This has been converted.

## `export const cborDecodeMulti = (encoded: Uint8Array): unknown[]`

This is redundant and will not be converted.

swift-cbor already has a method that achieves the same goal.
