#  ATCommonTools

A work-in-progress version of the common methods, classes, variables, and structures for the ATProtoKit family of Swift packages.

This package will update as needed. Many of the objects are converted from the [`common`](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/tree/main/packages/common) and [`common-web`](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/tree/main/packages/common-web) packages from the official [`atproto`](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto) TypeScript repository. Some objects will also be entirely new and are unrelated to the original TypeScript packages.

There's little documentation, and whatever sort of documentation that's actually available is messy. As time goes on, it will be cleaned up and properly formatted.
